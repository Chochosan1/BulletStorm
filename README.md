# BulletStorm
 
Roguelike/roguelite. 

The player controls a character (topdown view, WASD + Mouse) and faces hordes of enemies. 

Available major upgrades for a variety of character builds (multishot, freezing shot, explosive shot, electric shot, sideways multishot, instant kill shot, slowing shot and many more). 

Loot tables.

AI -> melee and ranged units that are easily edittable through the editor. Turn any unit into an explode-on-touch unit, into a melee fighter or into a wizard/archer that can shoot projectiles in different patterns and with different abilities (slow, freeze, etc.).

Bosses (on top of normal AI functionality they support spell casting) -> unit spawning, rocket firing to a marked area on the ground, dashing and more to come.

Many environmental interactions -> break stuff for bonuses (upgrade orbs, units or just wreak havoc if that's your thing).

Random elements.
